My contribution to the [CodinGame](http://www.codingame.com) 
[Ragnarok Challenge](http://www.codingame.com/cg/#!challenge:23) that ran on 
2014-02-22. I ended up 
[#58](http://www.codingame.com/cg/#!ranking:23:MercuryWood) with a score of 
90%.

`ragnarok.py` contains the code that I submitted to CodinGame on the day of
the contest. `ragnarok2.py` contains cleaner code that uses a very
similar algorithm. Both algorithms are written as pseudo-code at the top of the files.
