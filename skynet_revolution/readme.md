## The Chasm

Score : 100%

`the-chasm-original.py` contains the original submitted code. `the-chasm.py` contains a simplified version with an accent on readability. `the-chasm-coroutine.py` is the same as the latter but uses a coroutine instead of a closure, as an experiment. It turns out the closure is shorter and probably clearer.

## The Bridge

Score : 58%

`the-bridge.py` contains the original submitted code.
